TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Use of different functions such as if and for loops have bbeen touched on. However, i am still confused on the use of the bracket and what is defined and when. First time using the % symbol to divide numbers and get odd and even numbers. I do sometimes confuse myself with the Print and return functions as i initially think ok so that means it should print out a certain response (like in the case of the odd and even numbers i initially wrote print true) then on the debug console it showed that it was printing them but it wasnt the solution, it will take some time but hopefully will get around it. Exercise 3 was much more complicated and more practice is needed to get ontop of deciding what to do when making certain programs, i still have not got to grips with it and can't seem to do most of them.
I faced a syntax error where there was a small red line before my if statment and i can't seem to get rid of it. As a result my entire tests.py for exercise 3 doesnot seem to run.
